From the raw image, first the bias frame is removed. The bias is a 0 second exposure with no light. There are multiple bias frames, which can be combined using either the median of each pixel value across all the bias frames, or sigma clipping, which entails rjecting certain pixel values that are some multiple of the standard deviation (sigma) away from the mean. The bias is an additive offset, so it can be added or subtracted from the raw image. Next we remove the dark frame. This is a bias frame for some given exposure time that shows thermally excited electrons masquerading as\n",
    "photoelectrons. We first want to remove the bias from each dark frame, then combine all the dark frames by taking the median of all the values at a given pixel. The dark frame is also an additive offset. We finally remove the flat frame. We can make a flat frame by exposing the detector to a constatant source of light and removing the dark and bias frames from the linear response part of your flatfeild images and normalize it to the median of one. You can then find the combination of all the flat feilds and devide the raw image by the master flat.    "
